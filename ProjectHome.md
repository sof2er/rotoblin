# **Rotoblin 0.8.1 released, please read the installation to get it working** #
The rotoblin mod is an improved Frustian derived config which has lower item density and removes some fixed pill spawns.

It is becoming widespread in the European L4D competitive scene and it is going to be used in the upcoming ESL L4D events.

**Changelog 0.8.0 -> 0.8.1**
  * Reduced Infected Finale Spawn Radius to normal state, a small bug exists in the client UI which will quickly flash "spawn" and "too close to survivors", rest assured you can spawn without any problems as this is a client side UI bug.
